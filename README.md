# movie-recommendation

Using a small dataset comprising around 4500 movies, this model utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze key factors such as genre, movie overview, and the contributions of actors and directors. A popularity rating is integrated into the analysis to enhance the precision of the recommendations, resulting in a thoughtfully curated list of 10 films that closely align with the suggested movie.

This project has provided an opportunity for me to explore and adeptly apply libraries that were previously unfamiliar, contributing significantly to my skill development, particularly in the domain of Natural Language Processing.
